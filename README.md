## Installation

Ad-hok-utils expects to be used with at least version 0.1.1 of ad-hok

So install a compatible version of ad-hok (if not already installed) along with ad-hok-utils:
```
$ npm install --save ad-hok ad-hok-utils

# or if you use yarn:

$ yarn add ad-hok ad-hok-utils
```

## Usage with Typescript

Ad-hok-utils ships with its own Typescript typings so by following the installation step above
you should be ready to use it on a Typescript + React project

## Helpers

### `addEffectOnMount()`
```js
addEffectOnMount(
  callback: (props: Object) => Function
): Function
```

Accepts an effect callback to be run only once on component mount.
Thin convenience wrapper around [`addEffect()`](https://github.com/helixbass/ad-hok#addeffect)

```typescript
const MyComponent: FC<{name: string}> = flowMax(
  addEffectOnMount(({name}) => () => {
    console.log(`Initial name: ${name}`)
  }),
  ({name}) => <div>{name}</div>
)
```
